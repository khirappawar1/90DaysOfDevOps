# Day 57 – Resource Requests, Limits, and Probes

## Task
Your Pods are running, but Kubernetes has no idea how much CPU or memory they need — and no way to tell if they are actually healthy. Today you set resource requests and limits for smart scheduling, then add probes so Kubernetes can detect and recover from failures automatically.
## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Resource Requests and Limits
1. Write a Pod manifest with `resources.requests` (cpu: 100m, memory: 128Mi) and `resources.limits` (cpu: 250m, memory: 256Mi)
2. Apply and inspect with `kubectl describe pod` — look for the Requests, Limits, and QoS Class sections
3. Since requests and limits differ, the QoS class is `Burstable`. If equal, it would be `Guaranteed`. If missing, `BestEffort`.

CPU is in millicores: `100m` = 0.1 CPU. Memory is in mebibytes: `128Mi`.

**Requests** = guaranteed minimum (scheduler uses this for placement). **Limits** = maximum allowed (kubelet enforces at runtime).

**Verify:** What QoS class does your Pod have?

### Task 2: OOMKilled — Exceeding Memory Limits
1. Write a Pod manifest using the `polinux/stress` image with a memory limit of `100Mi`
2. Set the stress command to allocate 200M of memory: `command: ["stress"] args: ["--vm", "1", "--vm-bytes", "200M", "--vm-hang", "1"]`
3. Apply and watch — the container gets killed immediately

CPU is throttled when over limit. Memory is killed — no mercy.

Check `kubectl describe pod` for `Reason: OOMKilled` and `Exit Code: 137` (128 + SIGKILL).

**Verify:** What exit code does an OOMKilled container have?

### Task 3: Pending Pod — Requesting Too Much
1. Write a Pod manifest requesting `cpu: 100` and `memory: 128Gi`
2. Apply and check — STATUS stays `Pending` forever
3. Run `kubectl describe pod` and read the Events — the scheduler says exactly why: insufficient resources

**Verify:** What event message does the scheduler produce?

### Task 4: Liveness Probe
A liveness probe detects stuck containers. If it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.

1. Write a Pod manifest with a busybox container that creates `/tmp/healthy` on startup, then deletes it after 30 seconds
2. Add a liveness probe using `exec` that runs `cat /tmp/healthy`, with `periodSeconds: 5` and `failureThreshold: 3`
3. After the file is deleted, 3 consecutive failures trigger a restart. Watch with `kubectl get pod -w`

**Verify:** How many times has the container restarted?

inal Answer

👉 Was the container restarted? → ❌ NO

Restart count remains 0
Pod is still Running
Only traffic is stopped
🧠 One-Line Memory Trick

Liveness = life/death (restart)
Readiness = ready/not ready (traffic only)

### Task 6: Startup Probe
A startup probe gives slow-starting containers extra time. While it runs, liveness and readiness probes are disabled.

1. Write a Pod manifest where the container takes 20 seconds to start (e.g., `sleep 20 && touch /tmp/started`)
2. Add a `startupProbe` checking for `/tmp/started` with `periodSeconds: 5` and `failureThreshold: 12` (60 second budget)
3. Add a `livenessProbe` that checks the same file — it only kicks in after startup succeeds

**Verify:** What would happen if `failureThreshold` were 2 instead of 12?

### Task 7: Clean Up
Delete all pods and services you created.
